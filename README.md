# Horiseon

## Description
Repositiory contains code that has been cleaned and improved. The links in the navigation bar were not working properly and the HTML was not broken out properly to show the individual elements on the page. The CSS has also been cleaned up to avoid duplicate entries and add root variables. Accesible alt attributes have also been added for when the website is used with assistive technologies.
